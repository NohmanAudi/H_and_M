The fashion industry is a very volatile one. It depends on a huge number of factors influncing the success of a company. It starts from effeciency in internal business operations considering product quality and services associated with it, while looking at time-to-market and delivery. Customer satisfaction, retention, and portfolio "which define the customer perception" are high importance features to consider while evaluating the success of the business. They contribute to the public image of the company and its reputation. It is essential as well to look at the cash flow and market share, and to consider revenue and ROI.

In this project, I will leverage data published by H&M, that includes three different datasets namely: Transactions, Customers, Articles, to explore some of the factors mentioned above, and deliver insight from the data.
